# CS-Clone-in-Unreal-4-Blueprints
Just a small practice project. I cloned a few gameplay mechanics from classic games like Counter-Strike such as the plant and defuse mechanism or the buymenu. Still a very early build so not all features are ready nor good implemented.

Still very early access, by now only the core mechanics are working.

B Opens the buymenu  
I Adds money for testing purposes  
M Opens the team change menu (Doesn't do anything yet)
